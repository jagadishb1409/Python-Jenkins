# Installation

There are methods which you can install jenkins for practicing. I prefer Docker as u can run multiple containers on local machine
1. Azure
2. Docker
   - Install Docker locally and run this command to start the jenkins server
      ````console
      docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
      ````
   - once installation is done you can access this through localhost:8080
